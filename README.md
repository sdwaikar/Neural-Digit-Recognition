# MNIST Digit Classification Project üñäÔ∏è

This comprehensive project analyzes the MNIST dataset, featuring 70,000 handwritten digits, using various machine learning and deep learning models to predict digit classes with high accuracy. The models explored include K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Utilized `NumPy` and `Keras` for loading and preprocessing data, transforming images into normalized one-dimensional arrays suitable for model input.
- **Model Implementations:**
  - **KNN:** Achieved 97.05% accuracy; optimal for its simplicity and effectiveness on clear, distinct images.
  - **SVM:** Reached up to 98.26% accuracy with RBF kernel, highlighting its strength in high-dimensional spaces.
  - **Random Forest:** Consistently strong performer with a best accuracy of 97.12%, demonstrating robustness with an ensemble method.
  - **CNN:** Best model with a 99.55% accuracy, showcasing deep learning's capability in image recognition tasks.
